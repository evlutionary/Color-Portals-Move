Color-Portals
=============

Minecraft Bukkit Plugin: Color Portals

Main Page: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/color-portals.5546/

Color Portals lets users create portals in game with little effort and no commands to type!

Using wool, a sign, a stone-pressure plate, and a button, players can create their own portals!

Color-Portals-Move
==================
Adding in functionality related to moving portals. Specifically this is for the Movecraft plugin but the code extension can work for any instance that a portal has been repositioned as a whole, including worldedit and schematic placements. This enables repositioning of a portal collection without having to note all of the original portal designations and rebuilding - instead an extension of the player clicking the activation button checks the related portal entry and updates to current portal values if the portal sign and color are the same and the player clicking has permission to move portals. Otherwise it returns an error if the portal does not match or the player does not have permission to move.
